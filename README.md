# python-ascendex
Python API library for AscendEX designed with simplicity and performance in mind. Still heavily experimental.

Features:
- almost complete websocket api
- few methods from rest api that are not available in the websocket one
- no order book modelling done
- only cash/spot trading, no margin or futures
- weakly tested error handling
